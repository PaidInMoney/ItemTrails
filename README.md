### Item Trails

Item Trails is a lightweight, client-side mod that adds customizable particle trails to flying projectiles. It enhances visual clarity by making fast-moving items easier to track without affecting gameplay balance.

Trails render in real time behind projectiles such as tridents, ender pearls, arrows, and other thrown or shot items, and disappear instantly on impact. The mod is designed to be performance-conscious and safe to use on multiplayer servers.

Customization is handled through simple in-game commands, allowing you to control which projectiles have trails and which particles are used.
